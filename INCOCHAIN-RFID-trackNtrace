Gentlemen, yesterday I was to have lunch with someone and he could not go. They were flying in people for their training seminar and required 3 shipments, one of which went missing. He spent a couple of hours on the phone with UPS customer service trying to track this lost shipment. This scenario could cause problem for training seminar, or a complete plant shut down (if another scenario) and it is avoidable with INCOCHAIN!

The solution could be RFID and while not everybody requires RFID and nor is it required in every shipment, sometimes important shipments need to make it to destination on time or just in time! RFID could be utilized by throwing something in the box (if they do not have the printing capabilities or bar scanner for example) or it could be utilized as RFID printer / barscan (consider Intermec who manufactures these) and in fact, companies like UPS who offer computers free of charge to larger shippers could incorporate this technology. Nobody needs to spend 2 hours with customer service (a major cost or worse, a plant shut down, or shipment that never shows) and this would need to be integrated with GPS and could probably be tracked to within 3 feet of where the lost shipment is (be it in warehouse, etc.) A shipper could then bypass customer service altogether and track their shipment on the block explorer, a major advantage and take necessary steps to work with resolving this so this is solutions based application....probably nothing we could accomplish in time of hackathon, but we could exemplify this and this fits the mold for being completely paperless, using blockchain, and smart contracts.
