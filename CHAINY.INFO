Hello Marcos!

Thanks for reaching out. 
Good idea and project. We are also looking at Trade Finance from the P2P financing point of view using CryptoCash that we develop. 
But we can discuss this later. 
Back to your project. 

At this time the search is possible only by the record code ChainyShortCode. 
Why don’t you use it as a tracking code? It may be enough for the hackathon.
The form for such search you can try and put on your website. The approximate code look below ( note that we didn't test it) . 

As for the custom search fields, in general it’s possible but we don’t plan to do this in the near time. 
If we receive enough requests and donations, then we will think about doing it, along with creating widgets for easy placement of the search forms on any external websites. 

Sample code for search form, used at chainy website.

<form id="chainy_form"><input type="text" name="code"><input type="submit" value="find"></form>
<script>$('#chainy_form').submit(function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    var val = $('#chainy_form input[name="code"]').val();
    val = val.replace(/^https\:\/\/chainy\.link\//, '').replace(/^https\:\/\/txn\.me\//, '');
   if(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,7}$/.test(val)){
      document.location.href="https://chainy.link/" + val;
   }
});
</script>


Good luck,
